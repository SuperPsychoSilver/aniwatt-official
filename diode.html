      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        The date was <strong>February 4th, 2025</strong>. A warm spring breeze blew in the air as the winter's breath finally came to an end.  
        And that very day, a boy, in a normal school, received a project for his Coding class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assignment was clear: the students were to make a website and have it completed by <strong>June 6th, 2025</strong>.  
        The grade from this project would serve as the grade for their practical exam.  
        Everyone else began making their websitesâ€”one for random YouTube videos, another to help people learn, and even an online shopping site.  
        But that boy? He was different.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a <em>weeb</em>.  
        He decided to make a website to watch anime, read manga, watch cartoons, read comicsâ€”all that jazzâ€”  
        from the comfort of any device he could get his hands on.
      </p>
      <p><strong>And thus, AniWatt was born.</strong></p>

      <h2>The Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    As I said before, this site started as a simple class project and grew into something WAY bigger. Obviously, I used a bit of AI here and there to fix the things I couldn't, because I was literally pulling out my hair.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I'm already bald. ðŸ’€
  </p>
  <p>
    The services I used to make this, just in case you, YES YOU, or whoever's reading this is at all interested, and might get a little inspired or motivated to make your own, are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consumet API: <a href="https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org" target="_blank">https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org</a></li>
    <li>Render: <a href="https://render.com" target="_blank">https://render.com</a></li>
    <li>FreeDNS: <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org" target="_blank">https://freedns.afraid.org</a></li>
    <li>Jikan API: <a href="https://jikan.moe" target="_blank">https://jikan.moe</a></li>
    <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a></li>
    <li>ChatGPT: <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">https://chatgpt.com</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Like I said, it's a learning project, just to test the waters and see if coding and programming is something I like doing.
