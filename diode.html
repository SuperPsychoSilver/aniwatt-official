      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        The date was <strong>February 4th, 2025</strong>. A warm spring breeze blew in the air as the winter's breath finally came to an end.  
        And that very day, a normal boy, in a normal school, received a project for his Coding class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assignment was clear: the students were to make a website and have it completed by <strong>June 6th, 2025</strong>.  
        The grade from this project would serve as the grade for their practical exam.  
        Everyone else began making their websites—one for random YouTube videos, another to help people learn, and even an online shopping site.  
        But that boy? He was different.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a <em>weeb</em>.  
        He decided to make a website to watch anime, read manga, watch cartoons, read comics—all that jazz—  
        from the comfort of any device he could get his hands on.
      </p>
      <p><strong>And thus, AniWatt was born.</strong></p>

      <h2>The Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This website was created with the sole purpose of being a coding class assignment and a test of modern web technologies.  
        I aimed to explore the capabilities of various APIs, while also getting hands-on experience building a website from the ground up.  
        The project also served as an opportunity to learn about domain management using services like FreeDNS and afraid.org (a really amazing site btw)
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, this site is a learning tool—a showcase of the skills I’ve gained and a practical demonstration of how these APIs and stuff work together.
